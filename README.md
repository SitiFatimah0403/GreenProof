#✅ Revamped Project Theme: "GreenProof" – Web3 for Climate Action (SDG 13)
🌍 Theme

Use blockchain + smart contracts to fight climate change (SDG 13) by verifying eco-friendly actions (like tree planting, recycling, cleanups) and rewarding users with NFTs as proof of impact.
GreenProof NFT allows users to upload a photo as proof of their eco-friendly actions (like planting a tree 🌳 or recycling ♻️). This photo is then minted as an NFT on the blockchain, acting as a permanent, tamper-proof certificate that the action was done. It provides transparency, digital ownership, and public accountability for green contributions.
